UDFS is a parasite distributed file system in userspace.

It stores its data on multiple endpoints and using various steganography methods: from images uploaded on social networks to comments on blog posts.

The result is a virtually unlimited FS, accessible anywhere, with your data encrypted and replicated along with plausible deniability.
