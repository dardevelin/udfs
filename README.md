UDFS is a parasite distributed file system in userspace.

It stores its data on internet using multiple steganography methods: from images uploadled on free sites to whitespaces in blog posts.
You can set a higher goal on files you care the most; the system will always try to stay healthy and make multiple copies for redundancy.

The result is a virtually unlimited FS, accessible anywhere, with your data encrypted and plausible deniability.
